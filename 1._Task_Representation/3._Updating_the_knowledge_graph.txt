====== 3. Updating the knowledge graph ======
Created Monday 05 April 2021

If I bring in a new graph, the existing knowledge must update. It must do 3 things:
1. Among the additions, what has already been studied. If everything has been studied, it must reject the update.
2. It must add the node at the correct place, in terms of dependency. This requires the added graph to be represented in terms of the graph being added.
	See example: We wish to add "Partition" topic to our knowledge.
	{{./pasted_image.png?height=300}} → {{./pasted_image001.png?height=300}} → {{./pasted_image002.png?height=300}} → {{./pasted_image003.png?height=300}}
	For multichildren addition - Traverse both trees in parallel. At each matching node, add the subtrees of the matching(in addition and existing) children to the existing map. See below for clarification.
	{{./pasted_image004.png?height=300}}→{{./pasted_image005.png?height=300}}→{{./pasted_image006.png?height=300}}→{{./pasted_image007.png?height=300}}→{{./pasted_image008.png?height=300}}
	Quite surprisingly, this is nothing but this is exactly the "merge" option we are presented when moving/copying files.
	We don't need to implement this. Every file system implements this.
3. Deletion of topic, should recalculate all nodes.
