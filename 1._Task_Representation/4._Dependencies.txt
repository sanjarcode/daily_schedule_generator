====== 4. Dependencies ======
Created Tuesday 06 April 2021

=== What are dependencies? ===
Dependencies are topics you would want to know thoroughly, if you wish to understand the the main topic.

=== Are dependencies absolute? ===
Most of the time, a dependency is not fully required. There are 3 cases:
1. Only //**a part**// of a dependency. For example - you don't need to know assembly language to learn to code. But you do need to know that all ops in a computer are move/add and that a assembly is the way to do so.
2. We need //**more than**// the dependency. For example - you need to know about symbol table when understanding how data types and scopes are implemented, in addition to knowing that a 'compiler' exists, which is just 'told' in the first class in programming.
3. Sometimes you need a dependency as is - To design algorithms, you need to know all of the basic data structure.

=== How to represent dependencies ===
* We can use a score, out of 10, to represent how much a dependency is required. For the case where the dependency is not sufficient, we can add upto 5 points extra. If 15 is crossed, then we need to create chunk the dependency accordingly.
* An arrow without a score means 10/10.

=== What about common dependencies? ===
* This is not a problem in a DAG.
